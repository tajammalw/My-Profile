            <h2>My IT Journey</h2>
            <p>Starting from a young age, I've always been fascinated by technology. I began my career as an Avionis engineer, later switching on to Information Systems Management back in early 2000 after earning my certifications from Microsoft (MCSE), and Cisco (CCNA). After doing brief internships with Advanced Automation, and Menlo Logisticsin Atlanta GA, I got admission at Keller Graduate School of Management, Devry University in Master in Information Systems Management program in year 2002. Soon after graduation, I landed into a job with Atco Chemicals Manufacturing Company in Marietta, GA as the IT Manager. I worked with them until 2017. Then I ventured into cloud computing and earned my certfication of AWS Certified Solutions Architect. During this phase of conversion to cloud based systems, I developed a strong liking for software development, and started learning Python and web development from online sources like Udemy and Pluralsight. In 2020 we relocated to Phoenix, AZ. In Feb 2023 I got a chance to attend the introductory course on front-end web development from Sandiago State University (SDSU), which led to my subsequent registration in the AI Software Development course with SDSU in August 2024. This course offers a solid foundation in combining artificail intelligence (AI) with web development from the industry leaders.</p>
